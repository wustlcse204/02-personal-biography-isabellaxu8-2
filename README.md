# Assignment 01-Personal-Bio

For this assignment, you need to create a valid html web page containing a personal biography/resume/profile either for you, or for a famous celebrity.

You are required to make use of the HTML elements we have learned in class so far, and in chapters 1-4 of the book.

Specifically, your web page needs to include one of each of the following elements:

* Title
* Headings (at least one sub-heading)
* Paragraphs
* Bold or Strong
* Italic or Emphasis
* Horizontal Rule
* Abbreviation
* Unordered List, Ordered List, or Definition List
* Links - at least one link to an external website.

Note, this list is only of the required elements- feel free to use more than just these.
